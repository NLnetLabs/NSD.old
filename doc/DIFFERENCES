0. Introduction

The observed differences are described.  The names of the differences
refer to the statistics in Appendix A, which describe observations of
the differences in responses to real queries to a root name server and
a TLD name server.


0.1 Changes

Bind 8.3.4 to 8.3.6: The d-bcacheglu, d-nnocachns, and b-multrrset
differences are fixed in bind.

NSD 1.2.2 to 1.4.0-alpha1: NSD now does dynamic name encoding, so the
d-nameencod and d-nameencom differences no longer occur.


1. Authoritative Only Differences

The most frequently occurring differences are due to the fact that NSD
is a true 'authoritative only' server.  As such it does not return as
much non-authoritative data as bind8 does.  We do not expect these
differences to cause problems in resolvers.


1.1 d-bcacheglu - Out-of-Zone Glue

NOTE: This no longer applies to bind 8.3.6-REL.

Bind8 answers queries for out-of-zone (glue) A RRs
non-authoritatively; NSD does not and provides a referral.

Analysis:

Authoritative only service should not provide non authoritative data.

Example:

bind8: 115 21412 -   1/2/2 
A? NS1.FASTSERVER.NL.;
ns1.fastserver.nl. a 80.84.226.95;
fastserver.nl. ns ns1.fastserver.nl.
fastserver.nl. ns ns2.fastserver.nl.;
ns1.fastserver.nl. a 80.84.226.95
ns2.fastserver.nl. a 80.84.226.98;

NSD:  99 21412 -   0/2/2 
A? NS1.FASTSERVER.NL.;
fastserver.nl. ns ns1.fastserver.nl.
fastserver.nl. ns ns2.fastserver.nl.;
ns1.fastserver.nl. a 80.84.226.95
ns2.fastserver.nl. a 80.84.226.98;


1.2 d-nnocachns - Non Authoritative Answers 

Bind8 answers queries with non-authoritative data; NSD does not and
provides a referral.  This also happens on type=ANY queries.  In
essence it is the same difference as d-bcacheglue, just differentiated
from glue information for analysis purposes.

Analysis:

Authoritative only service should not provide non authoritative data.

Example:

bind8: 139 25304 -   3/0/3 
NS? flightcam.de.;
flightcam.de. ns ns.kdt.de.
flightcam.de. ns ns2.kdt.de.
flightcam.de. ns ns.wtal.de.;
ns.kdt.de. a 195.8.224.1
ns2.kdt.de. a 195.8.224.2
ns.wtal.de. a 212.17.226.130;

NSD:139 25304 -   0/3/3 
NS? flightcam.de.;
flightcam.de. ns ns.kdt.de.
flightcam.de. ns ns2.kdt.de.
flightcam.de. ns ns.wtal.de.;
ns.kdt.de. a 195.8.224.1
ns2.kdt.de. a 195.8.224.2
ns.wtal.de. a 212.17.226.130;



2. Bind Bugs

Some differences are due to bind bugs and/or bind answers not
conforming to the Internet standards.


2.1 b-multrrset - Multiple RRSets in Response

NOTE: This no longer applies to bind 8.3.6-REL (and later).

NSD does not send an RRset more than once in a response as per RFC2181
section 5.5.

Bind8 is observed to send the same RRset in both the answer and
Additional sections.  This is not conforming to the standard.

Analysis:

NSD answers correctly as per the standard.  Some incorrect and
particularly naive resolver implementations could be affected.  No
such implementation is known.

Example: 

bind8: 24531*- q: A? A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. 1/4/4 
A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 198.41.0.4 
ns: ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS f.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS j.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS k.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. 
ar: A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 198.41.0.4, 
f.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 192.5.5.241, 
j.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 198.41.0.10, 
k.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 193.0.14.129 (178) 

NSD:   24531*- q: A? A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. 1/4/3 
A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 198.41.0.4 
ns: ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS A.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET., 
ROOT-SERVERS.NET. NS K.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. 
ar: F.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 192.5.5.241, 
J.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 198.41.0.10, 
K.ROOT-SERVERS.NET. A 193.0.14.129 (162) 


2.2 b-rootdot - bind does not return NXDOMAIN on 'root.'

Bind does not answer NXDOMAIN on queries for 'root.' while this domain
does not exist in class IN.

Analysis:

Bind has a pseudo domain root. somewhere.  NSD does not.


2.3 b-nonxdom - bind misses NXDOMAIN when no zone cut

Bind8 refers to itself if it is asked for an authoritative answer in
cases where there is no zone cut but other data.

Analysis:

A bind bug.

Example:

zone file:
www.pool-effekt 86400 IN A              194.246.96.72

bind8: 82   889 *-  0/1/0 
A? pool-effekt.de.;
de. soa dns.denic.de. ops.denic.de. 2002031701 10800 7200 3600000 3600;

NSD:   82   889 *-  0/1/0 NXDOMAIN
A? pool-effekt.de.;
de. soa dns.denic.de. ops.denic.de. 2002031701 10800 7200 3600000 3600;


2.4 n-clrcdbit - NSD clears CD bit in response

NSD clears the CD header-bit in responses, bind copies it from the
query.  Security unaware servers should clear this bit as per RFC1035
4.1.1.

This difference no longer occurs with bind 8.4.4 (and maybe earlier
versions).


Analysis:

A bind bug.


3. Functionality Differences

The next group of differences are due to the fact that NSD does not
implement some functionality that is requested.  This is a design
choice and should not cause resolver problems at all.


3.1 d-nnotimpny - NSD returns Refused on notify requests

NSD returns NOTIMP to notify operations and does not return the
original query.

Example:

bind8: 29     0 -   0/0/0 notify ServFail
SOA? smgcinc.com.;

NSD:  12     0 *-  0/0/0 notify NotImp;

Analysis:

NSD does not implement Notify and answers accordingly.



3.2 d-nrefclass - NSD returns Refused on unknown class/type

NSD returns the error code REFUSED to queries with an unknown class or
RR type. bind returns SERVFAIL.

Analysis:

This is a permanent error.  Interpretation of the protocol standard
differs.

Example:

bind8: 32  1388 -   0/0/0 ServFail
Type0 (Class 256)? 10.225.125.182.;

NSD:   32  1388 -   0/0/0 Refused
Type0 (Class 256)? 10.225.125.182.;



3.3 d-nonrefut - NSD returns no data on refused update

NSD does not return the original message data on refused updates.

Analysis:

Interpretation of the RFCs differs.  Original data is not necessary,
dropping it increases DoS resilience.

Example:

bind8: 63  7610 -   1/1/0 update Refused
SOA? .;
doydoy.res.hmc.edu. (class 254) a 192.17.0.1;
doydoy.res.hmc.edu. a 134.173.62.172;

NSD:   12  7610 -   0/0/0 update Refused;


3.4 d-bindchaos - NSD does not implement the bind. TLD in class CHAOS

NSD does not implement the pseudo TLD 'bind' in class CHAOS to make
server characteristics available via the query interface. NSD does
implement the (proposed) 'server' pseudo TLS in class CHAOS instead.

NOTE: This no longer applies to NSD 1.2.3 and later.


4. Design Dependent Differences

This group of differences contains minor variations of responses due
to different design choices.  Starting with NSD-1.4.0 there are no
differences due to design choices anymore.


4.1 Different Name Encoding

NOTE: This no longer applies to NSD 1.4.0.

Since NSD pre-computes its answers for efficiency, in a very few cases
its name encoding differs from that generated by bind8.  These cases
occur when the parts of the answer can be encoded using parts of the
question.

The different encoding can affect the answer in three different,
increasingly severe ways.

- same response (d-nameencod)

  The content of the response is exactly the same, just encoded
  differently. The only effect of this is a slightly increased length
  of the response. In our observations the total output bandwidth
  increase caused by this is negligible. It is shown as "Added Bytes:"
  in the comparisons.

- same answer (d-nameencom)

  The answer is the same; the additional section is shortened by one
  or more RRsets. This may cause some loss of optimization in
  resolvers that may need additional queries to obtain some of the
  omitted information.  Note again that the answer is fully
  transmitted and thus the 'truncated answer' bit is not set.  The
  total number of omitted RRs is noted in the comparisons. We have
  only observed this when responding to queries for unusually long
  names.  The maximum omission observed was 1 RR.

  Note that beginning with NSD 1.1.0 this difference has not occurred
  in the traces we've used to compare BIND and NSD.

- truncated answer

  This is when the answer would be truncated and the 'truncated
  answer' bit set.  We have not observed this at all.


Analysis: 

This is an expected differences caused by design choices.
