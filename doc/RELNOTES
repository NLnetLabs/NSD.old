NSD RELEASE NOTES

3.2.3 (UPCOMING RELEASE)
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Bugfix #236: Allow RRs before the SOA in a zonefile.
	- Bugfix #249: Remove the C99 code.
	- Bugfix #253: Don't put NS RRs in a response with QTYPE=DNSKEY.
	- Bugfix #263: Make TSIG algorithm comparison case insensitive.
	- Bugfix #266: Build failed on systems without strptime.
	- Bugfix: install hickup.
	- Fix to use 4096 EDNS limit for IPv6 on Linux.

3.2.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Off-by-one buffer overflow fix while processing the QUESTION section.
	- Return BADVERS when NSD does not implement the VERSION level of the 
	  request, instead of 0x1<FORMERR>.
	- Bugfix #234.
	- Bugfix #235.
	- Reset 'error occurred' after notifying an error occurred at the $TTL or
		$ORIGIN directive (Otherwise, the whole zone is skipped because the
		error is reset after reading the SOA).
	- Minor bugfixes.

3.2.1
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- NSD will now fallback to AXFR, only if the master does not support IXFR.
	- You can adjust nsdc patch to skip textfile patching. This will 
	  increase the patching process, but will not output to zonefiles 
	  anymore. By default, this is off.

BUG FIXES:
	- When configuring, don't do strptime test when cross-compiling.
	- Bug #230: Output non-error messages to stdout.
	- Better error message when ixfr.db old file format is read.
	- Bug #218: shared UDP query for all interfaces.
	- Bug #222: Remove bashism from nsdc script.
	- Nicer check for SHA-256 functionality.
	- Fixed some minor memory leaks that occured on reload.
	- nsdc: check if a lockfile has not gone stale, when lock failed.
	- Bugfix strptime compatibility function

FEATURES:
	- New configuration option 'allow-afxr-fallback', "yes" by default. If
		set to "no", NSD will never do AXFR fallback, even if the master 
		does not support IXFR.
	- Allow file rotation on nsd.log.
	- The new nsd-patch options -s and -o allows you to skip writing 
		zonefiles and store the output directly to a database file, 
		respectively.

3.2.0
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Format of ixfr.db has changed. When you are planning an upgrade to the 
	  new NSD release, make sure to process the old ixfr.db before starting 
	  the new release (by running nsdc patch).
	- IXFR is transmitted over TCP by default instead of UDP. If you want to 
	  continue the use of IXFR/UDP, please modify your zone configuration 
	  file to:
		request-xfr: UDP 1.2.3.4 tsigkey
	  We strongly recommend to enable TSIG if you send IXFR over UDP.
	  When all masters fail to transmit IXFR/UDP, slave will fallback to 
		IXFR/TCP and eventually AXFR/TCP.
	- nsd-patch prints errors to stderr instead of stdout.

BUG FIXES:
	- Only normalize dnames in rdatas when rrtype is listed in RFC 4034, 
	  section 6.2: Canonical RR Form, following
	  draft-ietf-dnsext-dnssec-bis-updates (affects RRSIG and NSEC records).
	- Typo in zonec manpage.
	- Bugfix in log_finalize.
	- Fix race condition between nsdc patch and server reload.

FEATURES:
	- AXFR/TCP fallback in case of failing IXFR zone transfers.
	- RFC 4635: support for hmac-sha1 and hmac-sha256 TSIG algorithm 
		identifiers, "Bugfix #130".
	- Configure the source ip-address for notifies (master) and zone
		requests (slave) in nsd.conf, "Bugfix #148".
	- nsd-notify and nsd-xfer allow you to configure the outgoing 
		hostname and source port, in addition to the source address.
	- Additional debug and verbose log messages.

3.1.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Try to avoid race conditions with NSD reloading and nsdc running, 
		by writing pidfile before closing old parent process.
	- Fixed NSEC3 memory leak in the case NSEC3 is not needed.
	- Fixed some memory leaks that happened on error, mostly on
		zone transfer errors.
	- Bugfix #191: nsd-checkconf allowed only (max_interfaces-1) interfaces.

FEATURES:
	- The number of maximum interfaces allowed is configurable with
		--with-max_interfaces=<number> (thanks John Lightsey).

3.1.0
=============
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- Default locations of nsd.db, ixfr.db & xfrd.state are changed to
          the /var/db/nsd directory.

BUG FIXES:
	- Zone compiler gives more sane error messages when out of
	  diskspace and bug #172: when compiling single zone file.
	- Changed man pages format from mdoc to mansun, to support the Solaris OS.
	- Log tcp read error only when connection not reset by peer or when 
	  verbosity level is high.
	- RRs are compared without checking the TTL value.

FEATURES:
	- NSD is now NSEC3 enabled by default. You can disable it by configuring 
		NSD with --disable-nsec3.
	- Added "hide-version" configuration setting. Enabling this feature 
		stops NSD from answering to CHAOS class version requests.
	- Added bind2nsd 0.5.0 (http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net) in contrib/.
	- Report source and zone for denied AXFR attempts.

3.0.8
=============
FEATURES:
	- Better logging for nsd-notify (show 'broken' zone)
	- Add configuration for chkconfig to control nsd service.

BUG FIXES:
	- Fixed nsdc start when nsd already running: do not initialize server, 
		since it is already running.
	- Fixup bug where data related files are looked up in the wrong
	  directory when chrooted with chrootdir ending with a slash.
	- Fixup bug where nsd would return FORMERR if received an edns
	  query with version set to zero and rdlen larger than zero.
	- Fixed strptime, so that zonec will also work on systems with broken 
		strptime (like leopard :-))
	- Do not answer nsec3 wildcard information when DO bit is not set
	- Better logging when creating database failed.
	- Various spelling errors

3.0.7
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Error handling for malformed IXFRs improved.
	- Fixed man pages, consistent syntax.

3.0.6
=============
FEATURES:
	- Report source and zone for denied AXFR attempts.

BUG FIXES:
	- More elegant handling of malformed nsec3 records from a zone 
	  transfer.
	- Fixup ignored return value in region-allocator.
        - Added bind2nsd 0.5.0 (http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net) in contrib/.

3.0.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Fixed problem with reload waiting very long. If the OS has a 
	  raging herd problem, NSD could block in a UDP operation and
	  that process would stop reload from finishing. Made UDP sockets 
	  nonblocking. 
	- Made TCP listen sockets nonblocking. NSD could block in accept.
	- Handle the new CERT RDATA types defined in RFC 4398 (submitted by 
	  Mans Nilsson).
	- Fixed a bug where zonec would choke on unknown CERT RDATA types.
	- Change nsd-notify retry timer from linear into exponential
	  backoff (submitted by Mans Nilsson).
	- Debug flag (-d) behavior changed. Nsd now also forks children when 
	  run in debug mode.
	- Added verbosity mode (-V <level>) for extra operational logging.
	- zonesdir default is /etc/nsd.  This can be overridden in nsd.conf.
	- if clients drop the tcp connection this does not result in a logfile
	  entry, unless verbosity is set 2 or more.

3.0.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- zonec will print an error when other data is put next to a CNAME.
	- Fixup unaligned memory access that could occur when reading ixfr.db
	  with a partial transfer inside.
	- Fixup for the WKS RR type printout by nsd-patch and nsd-xfer.
	- Error message 'could not read database CRC' now only given on error.
	- ./configure --zonesdir=<directory for zone files> now works to
	  set a default value for the zonesdir: <dir> nsd.conf directive.
	  Set zonesdir: "" to disable the change of directory.
	- Bug: reload crashes with log message 'continuing with old database',
	  and after that no more zone updates. Manual fix is to kill -HUP,
	  but now fixed in software to try to reload again (and again).
	- Small speedup where xfrd could briefly be busy-waiting.
	- If master sends IXFR with glue that is already present in the zone
	  this is silently accepted. Printed in debug mode -L 2. To make
	  the log file smaller.
	- Exponential backoff for zones that never worked to max of 4 hours.
	  For expired zones the SOA retry values are used.
	- allow-notify acl entries 'NOKEY' match only queries without TSIG.
	- Answers to valid notifies contained wrong RR counts in the header.
	  The notifies were processed correctly, but now the acknowledgement
	  reply is in correct DNS format.
FEATURES:
	- Added contrib/nsd.zones2nsd.conf python script to convert NSD 2 to
	  NSD 3 config files, contributed by Stephane Bortzmeyer.
	- The nsdc control script will print 'nsd startup failed' if the nsd
	  executable does not start (due to bad permissions, bad config, ...).

3.0.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Bug #152: NSD would not use the identity from nsd.conf, fixed.
	- Bug #153: When running with thousands of secondary zones, NSD would
	  run out of UDP sockets. Caused crash on FreeBSD, errors on Linux
	  ('out of file descriptors'), depending on ulimits. Fixed.
	- Fixed getaddrinfo error message to be more descriptive.
	- Fallback to ip4 if getaddrinfo fails for ip6.
	- Will no longer lose a notify message during reloads (IPC).
	- Will no longer lose transfer in progress when notified for that zone.
	- Nicer error when operator forgets to rebuild after deleting a zone.

3.0.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- Nice error from zonec on a wrong configuration zone name.
	- Nicer warning from zonec when starting secondary zone with
	  no zone file for the first time.
	- nsdc makes more portable use of 'which' (for SunOS5.9/bash2.05).
	- Bug #143: Improved handling of zonesdir: directive and relative 
	  pidfile, database, diff file, xfrdfile paths in nsdc.sh and 
	  nsd-patch. They would not find the files.
	- Bug #144: LOC RRtype default values for precision wrong. Fixed.
	- Bug #145: NSD failed to reload cases of simultaneous zone transfer.
	- Bug #146: NSD fails to write to xfrdfile when chrooted. Fixed.
		Also fix for difffile when chrooted.
	- Bug #147: NSD runs out of memory. Fixed, memory is reused.
	  Occurred when running NSD with very big zones and large updates.
	- nsd -L 1 logging is smaller, -L 2 contains all debug information.
	  (only available for debug compiles).
	- Bug #149: Fixed text for NOTAUTH error code. When notify is not
	  authorised REFUSED error code returned instead.

3.0.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
	- nsd-patch prints SOA record at start of zone files.

3.0.0
=============
FEATURES:
	- AXFR/IXFR zone transfer supported.
		- NSD requests but does not provide IXFR transfers.
		- NSD keeps track of SOA timeouts for secondary zones.
	- TSIG authentication supported.
		- For queries, for notifies, for zone transfers.
	- NOTIFY messages of zone updates, incoming and outgoing.
	- DNAME type is supported, including CNAME synthesis.
	- config file, nsd.conf(5), place to put TSIG keys, server settings,
	  and lists of ip-addresses/ranges for AXFR/IXFR and NOTIFY.
	- prepared for NSEC3 (--enable-nsec3), experimental code for testing
	  in workshops.
	- prepared for NSID (--enable-nsid), experimental code for testing in 
	  workshops.

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
	- config file needed, nsd.conf(5) supersedes nsd.zones and nsdc.conf.
	- AXFR transfers are denied by default. Allow in config file.
	- Zones only become secondary with "request-xfr:" items in config file.
	- NSD produces "ixfr.db" file with a journal of zone transfers.
	  Use nsdc patch to merge changes back to zone files and remake db.
	- NSD produces "xfrd.state" file with zone timeout information.
	  The file is text formatted.
	- NSD sends notifies automatically,
	  nsd-notify is deprecated and will be removed from the package. 
	- NSD requests AXFR/IXFR and reloads the updates automatically, 
	  nsd-xfer is deprecated and will be removed from the package.
	- Check your config file with nsd-checkconf.

BUG FIXES: 
	- contains all bug fixes from 2.3.5 and before.
	- The sighandler() bug is fixed more thoroughly,
	  by using pipes for interprocess communication.
	- CNAMEs are followed by the server to different zones and
	  information from that zone is returned. This saves a followup
	  query.
	- bug fixes (ported) 2.3.6.
		- nsd-notify will retry max 15 times 5 second retries.
		- Bug #105: nsdc lacks locking, fixed locking for root user.

		- uninitialised variable fixed.
		- unaligned memory access (on Solaris SPARC), in zonec 
		  LOC parsing, fixed.
		- Bug #138: nsd aborts trying to bind all interfaces if ip6 
		  is not enabled, instead it will fallback to ip4.
		- Bug #139: resync timer for stats to whole minute.
		- Bug #140: NSD did not clear CD bit on authoritative answers.
		- Bug #141: NSD did not clear flags on a formerror reply.

2.3.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #132: regression, nsd: fix compile with --disable-ipv6
        - Makefile: remove gnuisms

2.3.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Unknown type codes for type code numbers > 48 and < 97 work again.       
          (this implies --enable-checking can be enabled again)
        - nsd: sighandler() fixes
	- Bug #118: nsd: nsd_notify waits for a response. Will retry the notify
	  after a timeout.
        - Bug #124: $(DESTDIR) was added to Makefile.in. 
	- Bug #128: zonec: parser can handle \\ at the end of a string.
        - zonec: lexer: add \r to the newline delimeter
        - zonec: use strtol with an explicit base 10 as parameter.
          (Scott Rose, Roy Arends)
        - nsd-xfer: print human readable error codes. Change logging to 
          be more in line with the rest

2.3.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Apply the correct patch to nsdc.sh.in. 

2.3.2
=============
FEATURES:
        - Bug #101: add support for the SPF record.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #100: replaced non-portable use of timegm(3) with
          portable implementation (mktime_from_utc).
        - Bug #103: nsd: trim the SOA's TTL to the MINIMUM value when returning a 
          negative answer.
        - Bug #104: nsd: add a time_t timestamp to the log when logging to
          a file.
        - Bug #105: nsdc: use a lock file when rebuilding the database (patch by
          Jakob Schlyter/Ted Lindgreen/Sebastian/Ondrej Sury).
        - Bug #106: zonec: don't walk all 256 NSEC windows when that is not
          needed.
        - Bug #107: zonec: fixed a crash when encountering bad unknown rdata.
        - nsd: Don't print: "error: nsd is already running as <pid>, stopping"
          when in fact NSD continues to run.
        - nsd: Minimize the race window in sig_handler().

2.3.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - zonec: Don't crash when generating error messages outside of zone
          files.
        - nsd: when logging to a file the pid is now printed.
        - nsd: Reset 'boot' time in statistics when reloading the database,
          since the statistics are reset to 0 on a reload.
        - nsd-xfer.c: Added '-a' option to specify local address to connect
          from.  Original patch supplied by Walter Hop <nsd@walter.transip.nl>.
        - Bug #98: Allow mnemonics for DS and RRSIG algorithm field.

2.3.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - DNSSEC is now enabled by default. NSD should be fully
          compliant with RFC4033, RFC4034, and RFC4035.

BUG FIXES:
        - nsd: Ensure that the number of -a flags does not exceed the
          maximum specified by MAX_INTERFACES in config.h.
        - nsd-xfer: Use serial number arithmetic (RFC1982) for the
          zone serial check
        - nsdc: Don't pass (fake) serial number to nsd-xfer if the
          zone file does not exist.
        - zonec: Loading many zones would cause namedb_find_zone to
          slow down, performance patch by Kazunori Fujiwara.
        - Bug #96: nsd-xfer did not handle 8-bit domain names
          correctly.

2.2.1
=============
FEATURES:
        - The message priority is now included when logging to a file.

BUG FIXES:
        - Zero length RDATA using the unknown RR notation was not
          working (except for the APL RR type).
        - Bug #93: './configure' error message containing a comma must
          be properly bracketed.
        - Bug #94: nsd-xfer: Handle unexpected EOF when receiving AXFR
          data.  Timeout if no data is received for more than 120
          seconds (see the TCP_TIMEOUT parameter in config.h).
        - Bug #95: An owner starting with an asterisk label ("*") was
          being treated as its own wildcard child.

2.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd-xfer: replacement program for named-xfer to perform zone
          transfers using AXFR. TSIG is supported by nsd-xfer but not
          yet by the nsd server. DNSSEC is also supported.  TSIG
          requires OpenSSL version 0.9.7 or higher, configure using
          --disable-tsig if you do not have OpenSSL installed.
          Configure using --with-ssl=path if OpenSSL is not installed
          at a standard location.

CODE CHANGES:
        - New data structure 'buffer_type' for representing binary
          buffers that can be read, written, and resized.  Data in
          these buffers is stored in network byte order.  This data
          structure replaces the iobuf field of 'struct query'.

BUG FIXES:
        - Fixed endian problem in WKS record.
        - Protocol can now be specified numerically in WKS record.
        - Allow escape sequences (\DDD) in TTL, RR class, and RR type.
        - The zone compiler now accepts many more characters in
          unquoted strings such as domain name labels.  The characters
          no longer need to be escaped with a backslash.
        - Close included files after reading.
        - Maximum TCP message size is now 65535 bytes.  AXFR response
          packets are still limited to 16383 bytes for optimal
          compression of dnames.
        - The TSIG key for AXFRs can now also be stored in the file
          <zonename>.tsiginfo.  This makes it possible to use TSIG
          with multiple master servers.
        - Signals are no longer blocked while performing I/O so the
          server should respond quicker to signals.
        - Fixed parsing of LOC rdata.  Fractions and altitude were not
          handled correctly.

2.1.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #90: handle \000 in TXT records correctly
        - Fixed undefined behavior in the use of vsnprintf when
          logging messages.  This caused crashes on Linux/PPC.

2.1.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - nsdc: Fixed a typo that caused AXFRs to stop working.

2.1.3
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd: The pidfile can be specified using the '-P' option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #87: allow @ in the rdata
        - Bug #88: allow ::FFFF:ipv4addr in AAAA records
        - Bug #89: Count the number of queries received over TCP,
          instead of the number of TCP connections.
        - Zonec: when - is used as input, set the filename to 'STDIN'.
        - The nsdc script handles failed AXFRs more gracefully.
        - NSD emits an error when it sees bitlabels (RFC 2673).
        - Only copy the CD bit when DNSSEC is enabled.

2.1.2
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD now fully supports unknown record types using the
          notation specified in RFC3597.
        - Support for the following RR types has been added: WKS, X25,
          ISDN, RT, NSAP, PX, NAPTR, KX, CERT, DNAME, and APL.  DNAME
          special processing is not supported.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #84: NSD now uses SIGUSR1 instead of SIGILL to report stats.
        - Bug #85: Support for WKS records.
        - Bug #86: The characters "#%&^[]?" can now be used without
          backslash in zone file domain names.
        - Plugin callback return type fixed.
        - The maximum message length for IPv6 UDP packets is now
          limited to the IPv6 minimum MTU (1280) unless the
          IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option is supported.

2.1.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #81: Handle unknown types correctly.
        - Bug #82: Zonec: don't report "0 errors" unless -v is
          specified.
        - Bug #83: Close zone files after parsing.
        - Handle AFSDB RR type.

2.1.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - New networking code allows a single server to handle both
          UDP and TCP connections.  By default up to 10 simultaneous
          TCP connections are supported.  Use the '-n' flag to change
          the default.

2.0.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Allow the use of a mnemonic for the algorithm field of a
          DNSKEY record.
        - Behavior of the zonec -v flag has been modified.  By default
          zonec will only print a single line with a summary of the
          error count.
        - Bug #75: Fixed typo in previous "fix".

2.0.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Queries for QTYPE DS (DNSSEC) were not handled correctly in
          certain cases.
        - Partial support for unknown RRs.  Known RR types with
          unknown RR data format is not yet supported.
        - Bug #75: Fixed bad error message when nsdc update is run for
          the first time.
        - Bug #78: Multiple zones, each with include directives, are
          now compiled correctly.

2.0.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - Experimental DNSSEC support implemented, but disabled by
          default.  Enable using the --enable-dnssec configuration
          option.
        - IPv6 enabled by default.  Disable using the --disable-ipv6
          configuration option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #47: Domain name is now logged when a notify is
          received.
        - Bug #70: First include all A records in the additional
          section, followed by AAAA records.
        - Bug #77: Check length of domain name and label.
        - LOC records are supported again.

1.4.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New database format that is much more compact and portable
          across architectures.
        - The new zone compiler is now the default and the old zone
          compiler has been removed.
        - Name compression is done dynamically, removing one other
          difference with BIND in the responses generated (the full
          query name is now used for compression).
        - CNAME target records are now generated from wildcard
          records if necessary.

REGRESSIONS:
        - mmap(2) isn't currently supported.
        - Not all RR types are supported by zonec (such as LOC).

1.3.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New name lookup algorithm.  This required a change to the
          database format.  Performance should increase at the expense
          of database size and memory usage.
        - New zone compiler (zonec2) based on flex and yacc, fully RFC
          compliant (still in alpha).
        - Database can be loaded using mmap(2) (use the --enable-mmap
          configure option to enable).  This is useful on operating
          systems such as Solaris that do not allow memory overcommit.
        - Region based memory allocation and resource management.
        - New internal format for storing domain names.  Each dname
          now includes an array of label offsets within the domain
          name.
        - Updates to the plugin API.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.

1.2.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #72: If an RRset for a child domain is defined before
          the RRset of the parent domain the parent's RRset would be
          "lost".

1.2.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.
        - NSD would try to kill pid -1 on startup if forking of a child
          process failed.
        - Do not log EAGAIN errors on calls to recvfrom.  These errors
          should be harmless.

1.2.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #59: NSD returns FORMERR when the query name is >= 246
          bytes.
        - Bug #60: Zonec runs out of file descriptors with many zones.
        - Bug #61: nsdc uses /bin/sh hardwired (and should not).
        - Bug #62: NSD is not able to log to a file.
        - Bug #63: nsdc update and zonec are too tallkative.
        - Bug #64: Answer for request of a host resolved by a
          wildcard-resource-record is not understandable by dig.

1.2.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - AXFR terminates early if a zone containa a CNAME pointing
          the the zone's domain name (SOA record) (bug #56).
        - During an AXFR memory above the top of the stack was
          accessed.  This could lead to occassional AXFR errors (bad
          packets).
        - NSD now prints its version number and exits when invoked
          with the -v flag (bug #57).
        - NSD prints help information and exits when invoked with the
          -h flag.

1.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD is now a single parent process (handling child
          termination and database reloads) plus multiple UDP and TCP
          child processes handling queries.  Before the parent process
          also handled UDP queries.  This change simplifies the parent
          and child processes and allows the use of multiple
          concurrent UDP servers.
        - Experimental plugin support.  This required a minor,
          incompatible change to the database format.  Make sure you
          recompile your database.  Use --enable-plugins to enable.
        - Full IPv6 support (for multi-homing and for Linux, thanks to
          Colm MacCárthaigh and Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).  Use
          --enable-ipv6 to enable.
        - Support for multi-homing with TCP connections.
        - Support for SunOS 4.x has been dropped.

CODE CHANGES:
        - NSD should now conform to the Single Unix Specification
          (http://www.unix.org/).
        - Const correctness for strings and some other data types.
        - Removed code for Berkeley DB, hash tables, and mmap(2).
        - Separate preprocessor flags from code flags (CPPFLAGS and
          CFLAGS).
        - Use uint8_t instead of u_char, uint{16,32}_t instead of
          u_int{16,32}_t.
        - Fixed warnings from mixing signed and unsigned types.
        - Use sigaction(2) instead of signal(2).
        - The query_process function has been split up for clarity.

BUG FIXES:
        - CHAOS TXT queries failed on big-endian machines.
        - Portability fixes for Tru64 (thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer),
          HP-UX, and MacOS X (thanks to Ronald van der Pol).
        - Removed compile time limit on maximum number of TCP child
          servers.
        - Support for debugging UDP and TCP queries.
        - Always ensure there is enough room for the EDNS record when
          answering a query with EDNS enabled.

KNOWN BUGS:
        - please see appropriate man pages for the known bugs

1.0.0 RELEASE
=============

KNOWN BUGS:

- Although NSD allows one to configure a zone without SOA record and
  use it as so called ``cached'' non-authoritative data, it is decided
  that having this functionality is wrong, dangerous and will be removed
  from the further versions.

- If while processing EDNS(0) OPT record NSD encounters bad EDNS(0)
  version it will answer with Format Error instead of EDNS(0) BADVERS
