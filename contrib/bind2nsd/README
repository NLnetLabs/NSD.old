bind2nsd -- translate from BIND named.conf to NSD nsd.conf
         -- then, sync up configuration files with a Secure64 server


To install these tools:

   # ./install.sh

Then, copy bind2nsd.conf to the directory you will run these commands
from (e.g., /etc/named or /etc/bind9) and then edit the values properly.

Passwords for logging into a system can be stored in the bind2nsd.conf
file (as clear text only) or can be stored encrypted by using the 
'password_file' config item and the s64-mkpw utility.

NOTE: you will also need the Python pexpect and pyDes modules.  These
can be found on SourceForge at:

   http://pexpect.sourceforge.net
   http://pydes.sourceforge.net

The source contained here is a slightly abridged version (test suite
removed, and some other odds and ends, in order to conserve space).
If you would like a complete tarball, you can download full bind2nsd 
source from SourceForge:
