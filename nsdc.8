.Nm nsdc
.Ar start|stop|reload|rebuild|restart|running|update|notify
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ic Nsdc
is the shell script that used to control
.Xr nsd 8
and
.Xr zonec 8
from
.IC NSD
distribution.
.Ic Nsdc
is also suitable to be linked into
.Pa /etc/rc.d
directory on
.Em BSD
like systems for automatic startup of
.Xr nsd 8
at the boot time.
.Pp
Possible
.Ic nsdc
applications are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar start
Start
.Xr nsd 8
.It Ar stop
Shut down
.Xr nsd 8
by sending
.Em SIGTERM
to it.
.It Ar reload
Initiate
.Xr nsd 8
name space database reload by sending
.Em SIGHUP
.It rebuild
Rebuild the
.Xr nsd 8
database by invoking
.Xr zonec 8
with appropriate arguments.
.It Ar restart
Restart
.Xr nsdc 8
This equals to nsdc stop && nsdc start
.It Ar running
Check whether
.Xr nsd 8
is running. Returns error message and error code if it is not
running, and no message and zero error code otherwise.
.It Ar update
Updates all the slave zones which have
.Em master
keyword in
.Pa nsd.zones
file from its masters and invokes
.Em nsdc rebuild
and
.Em nsdc reload
if necessary.
.It Ar notify
Sends
.Em notify
message to all the masters for all the zones that have
.Em notify
keyword in
.Pa nsd.zones
file.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Pa README
file for detailed description of
.Pa nsd.zones
file format.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Pa /etc/nsd.zones
Default location of configuration file.
.It Pa /etc/nsd/nsd.db
default
.Ic NSD

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Ic Nsdc
will return zero return code if operation was successful and
an error message to standard output plus a non-zero return code
otherwise.

.Xr README
.Sh AUTHORS
.Ic NSD
was written by NLnet LABS and RIPE NCC joint team. Please see CREDITS file
in the distribution for further details.
.Sh BUGS
.Pa nsd.zones
syntax checking is almost nonexistent in
.Ic nsdc
erroneous lines are most likely to be ignored or will produce unexpected
results. There is no locking for
.Em nsdc rebuild
and
.Em nsdc update
operations so those should be used with caution.
.Pp
.Em nsdc
update with more than one master will give error messages and wont work
with tsig. To fix the problem one can comment out checking for tsig
file presence in
.Em nsdc.sh.in
