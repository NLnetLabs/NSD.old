1.0.0 RELEASE
=============

KNOWN BUGS:

- Although NSD allows one to configure a zone without SOA record and
  use it as so called ``cached'' non-authoratative data, it is decided
  that having this functionality is wrong, dangerous and will be removed
  from the further versions.

- If while processing EDNS(0) OPT record NSD encounters bad EDNS(0)
  version it will answer with Format Error instead of EDNS(0) BADVERS
