	- ``cache'' zones are no longer allowed

	- AXFR implemented

DESIGN CHANGES:

1.0.0 RELEASE
=============

KNOWN BUGS:

- Zone compiler will not parse properly zone files where comments or
  parenthes are not surrounded with white space. For example, this is
  NOT a valid syntax:

	... MX 20 relay1;This is a comment
	               ^^

 This will fail as well:
	                   vv
	SOA hostmaster ns1 (2002151000 ; Serial

- Although NSD allows one to configure a zone without SOA record and
  use it as so called ``cached'' non-authoratative data, it is decided
  that having this functionality is wrong, dangerous and will be removed
  from the further versions.

- If while processing EDNS(0) OPT record NSD encounters bad EDNS(0)
  version it will answer with Format Error instead of EDNS(0) BADVERS

PLATFORMS:

	Tested and working on i386 FreeBSD-4.4, i386 Linux, dec alpha Linux,
	sparc SunOS 4.x
