DIFF support file format.

This file contains changes to the main NSD-DATABASE file.

Diff file:
- Magic "NSDdfV01"
- CRC32 of base database.

Parts, each part has
- 32 bits type field.
- 32 bits length field.
- length bytes of content.
- 32 bits repeat of the length field.

TYPE="IXFR"
contents is IXFR packet contents (the RRs). 
(or contents is AXFR, since IXFR spec allows for that)
without a SURE part, it is probably sent with bad tsig.

TYPE="SURE"
contents is:
a) reference to the IXFR packet that is OKed.
	- new SOA rr packet.
	- this must be the IXFR immediately preceding the SURE.
b) uint8: commit=1(IXFR is OK) or rollback=0(ignore that IXFR). 
c) space for a text string message (0 terminated), i.e.
	'at time <stamp> came from <addr>, tsig checked with key <key>'.
	or rejected <reason for rejection>.

Unknown types are an error.
A part truncated by EOF must be ignored.
A part that ends in a bad length field must be ignored.

xfrd only appends the file or truncates trailing garbage.
reload only reads the file.
