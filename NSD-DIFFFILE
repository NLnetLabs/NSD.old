DIFF support file format.

This file contains changes to the main NSD-DATABASE file.

Diff file:
- Magic "NSDdfV01"
- CRC32 of base database.

Parts, each part has
- 32 bits type field.
- 32 bits length field.
- length bytes of content.
- 32 bits repeat of the length field. (wrong=error).

TYPE="IXFR"
contents is IXFR packet contents (the RRs). 
(or contents is AXFR, since IXFR spec allows for that)
without a SURE part, it is probably sent with bad tsig.

TYPE="SURE"
contents is:
a) zone apex that is committed (OK). IXFR for zone must be before.
b) new SOA serial that is OK.
c) commit=1(IXFR is OK) or rollback=0(ignore that IXFR) (1byte). 

Unknown types are an error.
A part truncated by EOF must be ignored.
