Cutest is the framework used for unit testing.
Thanks to asimjalis@peakprogramming.com (main author)
and Dave Glowacki(contributor) for cutest.

CuTest.c and CuTest.h fall under the license of CuTest.license.txt.

The source is altered from its original distribution:
- Original was cutest-1.4.tar.gz tarball.
- files AllTests.c, CuTestTest.c, make-tests.sh and README are left out.
- Wouter Wijngaards tried to fixup so that summary output is written 
  immediately (so you can see the .s printed), using CuSuiteRunDisplay().
