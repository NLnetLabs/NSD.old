.RB [ \-s 
.IR server ]
.IR command
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B nsd\-control
performs remote administration on the \fInsd\fR(8) DNS server.  It reads
the configuration file, contacts the nsd server over SSL, sends the
command and displays the result.
.P
The available options are:
.TP
.B \-h
Show the version and commandline option help.
.TP
.B \-c \fIcfgfile
The config file to read with settings.  If not given the default
config file @nsdconfigfile@ is used.
.TP
.B \-s \fIserver[@port]
IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server to contact.  If not given, the
address is read from the config file.
.SH "COMMANDS"
There are several commands that the server understands.
.TP
.B start
Start the server. Simply execs \fInsd\fR(8).  The nsd executable 
is searched for in the \fBPATH\fR set in the environment.  It is started 
with the config file specified using \fI\-c\fR or the default config file.
.TP
.B stop
Stop the server. The server daemon exits.
.TP
.B status
Display server status. Exit code 3 if not running (the connection to the 
port is refused), 1 on error, 0 if running.
.SH "EXIT CODE"
The nsd\-control program exits with status code 1 on error, 0 on success.
.SH "SET UP"
The setup requires a self\-signed certificate and private keys for both 
the server and client.  The script \fInsd\-control\-setup\fR generates
these in the default run directory, or with \-d in another directory.
If you change the access control permissions on the key files you can decide
who can use nsd\-control, by default owner and group but not all users.
The script preserves private keys present in the directory.
After running the script as root, turn on \fBcontrol\-enable\fR in 
\fInsd.conf\fR.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
.I @nsdconfigfile@
nsd configuration file.
.TP
.I @configdir@
directory with private keys (nsd.key and nsd.key) and
self\-signed certificates (nsd.pem and nsd.pem).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fInsd.conf\fR(5), 
\fInsd\fR(8).
