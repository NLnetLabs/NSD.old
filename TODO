AUTOCONF

- check whether the --with-nsd-user exists in the system

ZONE COMPILER
- memory allocation optimization is needed
- parser is too smart: should not try to continue processing if there are errors...
- as writing the zone the order should be DNS SEC compliant (use dnameinvert())
- missing closing quote doesnt register as an error
- MINOR BUG: unknown types and custom formats dont ever get freed()
- error diagnostic has to be improved a lot
- fix the ds parsing things

This will generate an error, when in the end of file:

                                        9n2kQyFLrkbbU84Jwks53iGXf7I= )

                        DS      35861 5 1 (
18D0E3FE93A6FB31AF9B85359CAF5719D2986CE8 )
- add a check to make sure that the biggest answer in the database does not
  exceed the query buffer
- fix the strdname() routine


SERVER
- handle unknown types as known types
- in tcp the timeout should be handled different than with alarm()?
- replace all ntohs(..) with #define .... something[i] and ntohs() it beforehand
- make sure that we dont copy anything from the query we dont want to copy, like
  funny headers etc
- query buffer is now 64k, perhaps we want it smaller? (used to be 1k)

SECURITY

PURITY
- some data is in network order some in host order, make it clear with prefixes
- brush up the fuction and identifiers names
- bzero pads so the databases can be cmp'd

TESTS
- set all the buffer sizes to ridiculously small values see if it causes
  core dumps

MISC
- functions should be regrouped differently in .c files, so nsd-notify
  doesnt have to be linked with all the unnecessary stuff

DOCUMENTATION

- convert the manual pages into -man macros set for better compatibility?
- update DESIGN document
