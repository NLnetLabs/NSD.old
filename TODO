AUTOCONF

+ check whether the --with-nsd-user exists in the system

ZONE COMPILER
- memory allocation optimization is needed
- as writing the zone the order should be DNS SEC compliant (use dnameinvert())
- error diagnostic has to be improved a lot
- add a check to make sure that the biggest answer in the database does not
  exceed the query buffer
- improve the strdname() routine
+ empty node should not cause NXDOMAIN


SERVER
- in tcp the timeout should be handled different than with alarm()?
- replace all ntohs(..) with #define .... something[i] and ntohs() it beforehand
- make sure that we dont copy anything from the query we dont want to copy, like
  funny headers etc
- query buffer is now 64k, perhaps we want it smaller? (used to be 1k)

SECURITY

PURITY
- some data is in network order some in host order, make it clear with prefixes
- brush up the fuction and identifiers names
- bzero pads so the databases can be cmp'd

TESTS

MISC

CLEANUP
- proper error/fatal/warning interfaces
- separate parse for nsd.zones

DOCUMENTATION

- convert the manual pages into -man macros set for better compatibility?
- update DESIGN document
