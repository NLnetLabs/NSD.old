ZONE COMPILER
- memory allocation optimization is needed
- parser is too smart: should not try to continue processing if there are errors...
- as writing the zone the order should be DNS SEC compliant (use dnameinvert())

SERVER
- in tcp the timeout should be handled different than with alarm()?
- replace all ntohs(..) with #define .... something[i] and ntohs() it beforehand
- make sure that we dont copy anything from the query we dont want to copy, like
  funny headers etc

SECURITY

PURITY
- some data is in network order some in host order, make it clear with prefixes
- brush up the fuction and identifiers names
- bzero pads so the databases can be cmp'd

TESTS
- set all the buffer sizes to ridiculously small values see if it causes
  core dumps

MISC
- functions should be regroupped differently in .c files, so nsd-notify
  doesnt have to be linked with all the unnecessary stuff
