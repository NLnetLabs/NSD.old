ZONE COMPILER

- the * should not be compressed against owner name!!!! XXX

DATABASE

- add separate masks for '*' zone cuts and data



---------- OLD TODO from the prototype ---------------
SECURITY

- all the arrays limits are not checked no nowhere
- buffer limits have to be checked
- runaway dnames in the packets

BUGS

1. both in zone->destroy and zone->print handle rrs at apex
2. dnametoa, strdname etc needs to have checks for buffer overruns
3. strdname write one zero too many or dnametoa prints one too few?


PARSER

- detect out of zone records (by using zone_search that detects authority
  cuts, or maybe second stage parsing?)
- set clear AA bit for every record
- make links to complimentary records
- parse TTL 2d5h3m10s
- ttl should be taken from SOA ttl if there's no $TTL
- shoudl check the buffer sizes. think of thousands of the same A glue
  record which is misconfigured and tries to be added to a packet

SERVER

- when receiving too long of a packet select will go into infinite loop?
- in tcp the timeout should be handled different than with alarm()?
- decide where and how CNAME resolution should be done

INITIALIZATION

- make sure that zones are properly sorted in the zones list

PURITY

- dname sometimes has the entire length as a first byte and sometimes not
- all the data is in network byte order except of the types (can anybody
  think of smart initialization?)
- brush up the fuction and identifiers names

TESTS

- set all the buffer sizes to ridiculously small values see if it causes
  core dumps
