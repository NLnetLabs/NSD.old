.SH WARNING
\fBnsd\fR is currently ALPHA code. There is still rough edges and
bugs. If you run into them please contact \fInsd-bugs@nlnetlabs.nl\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nsd
is the \fBn\fRame\fBs\fRerver \fBd\fRaemon written by NLnet Labs in cooperation
with RIPE NCC. \fBnsd\fR was written with the following goals
in mind:
.TP
.B RFC Compliant
\fBnsd\fR is fully compliant with the relevant RFC (1034/35 etc). Only
were there is a speed tradeoff the compliancy is relaxed (see ???).
.TP
.B Speed
The main purpose of \fBnsd\fR is to be able handle lots and lots of
queries (O(20k/sec)), without breaking a sweat. It's main use
is thus on heavy loaded servers, like the root-server and TLD servers.
.TP
.B Only authoritative
To increase its spead \fBnsd\fR does not do any recursion. And thus
only suitable on authoritative nameservers.
.TP
.B Compatible with \fBBIND\fR
\fBnsd\fR should behave exactly as \fBBIND8/9\fR? does. See [BLA] for
more information.
.TP
.B No code sharing with \fBBIND\fR
There is no code from \fBBIND4/8/9\fR in \fBnsd\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
turn on debugging, \fBnsd\fR will be much more generous with error
messages.

.TP
.B \-v
turn on verbose mode, \fBnsd\fR will be give much more information.

.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fR
specify the port number \fBnsd\fR will use. This defaults to 53.

.TP
.B \-f \fIdatabase\fR
specify the database to use. The \fIdatabase\fR given
as a argument will superseed this option.

.TP
.B database
the \fBdatabase\fR \fBnsd\fR will use. This superseeds the \fB-f\fR
option (if given).

.SH DATABASE
The database contains all the information about the configured zones
in a \fImachine dependent\fR format. It is nessecary to compile the
zone information into this format, \fBzonec\fR is used for this purpose
(see man 8 zonec).

.SH FILES
[EXTEND] Lots and lots of them.

.SH AUTHORS
\fBnsd\fR is written by Alexis Yushin, Ted Lindgreen, Miek Gieben,
Erik Roozendaal, Olaf Kolkman, Daniel Karrenberg.
