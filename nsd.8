[ \fB\-f \fIdatabase\fR ]
[\fB\-p \fIport\fR]
.BI database

.SH WARNING
\fInsd\fR is currently ALPHA code. There are still rough edges and
bugs. If you run into them please contact \fInsd-bugs@nlnetlabs.nl\fR.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nsd
is the \fIn\fRame\fIs\fRerver \fId\fRaemon written by NLnet Labs in cooperation
with RIPE NCC. \fInsd\fR was written with the following goals
in mind:
.TP
.B RFC Compliant
\fInsd\fR is fully compliant with the relevant RFC (1034/35 etc). Only
were there is a speed trade off the compliance is relaxed (also see
REQUIREMENTS in the \fInsd\fR source).
.TP
.B Speed
The main purpose of \fInsd\fR is to be able handle lots and lots of
queries (O(20k/sec)), without breaking a sweat. It's main use
is thus on heavy loaded servers, like the root-server and TLD servers.
.TP
.B Only authoritative
To increase its speed \fInsd\fR does not do any recursion. And thus
only suitable on authoritative nameservers.
.TP
.B Compatible with \fIBIND\fR
\fInsd\fR should behave exactly as \fIBIND8/9\fR does. See
REQUIREMENTS for more information.
.TP
.B No code sharing with \fIBIND\fR
There is no code from \fIBIND4/8/9\fR in \fInsd\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
turn on debugging, \fInsd\fR will be much more generous with error
messages.

.TP
.B \-p \fIport\fR
specify the port number \fInsd\fR will use. This defaults to 53.

.TP
.B \-f \fIdatabase\fR
specify the database to use. The \fIdatabase\fR given
as a argument will supersede this option.

.TP
.B database
the \fBdatabase\fR \fInsd\fR will use. This supersedes the \fB-f\fR
option (if given).
The database contains all the information about the configured zones
in a \fImachine dependent\fR format. It is necessary to compile the
zone information into this format, \fIzonec\fR is used for this purpose
(see man 8 zonec).

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file \fInsd\fR uses has the following syntax
(";" denotes a comment):

.BR

; zone type     origin          pathname

cache           .               root.cache

zone            example.com     example.com

The first word on a line must be \fIcache\fR or \fIzone\fR.
It indicates that the zone should be loaded as authoritative data 
(in case of \fIzone\fR) or just like non-authoritative redirection 
information in case of \fIcache\fR.

Second word is the name (\fIorigin\fR) of the zone.
The third word is the \fIpathname\fR to the zone file. 

.SH AUTHORS
\fInsd\fR is written by                
Alexis Yushin, Eric Roozendaal, Ted Lindgreen, Miek Gieben (all NLnet
Labs) and Olaf Kolkman, Daniel Karrenberg both from RIPE NCC.
