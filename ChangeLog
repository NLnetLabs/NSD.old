   * Wouter: Improved configure.ac to detect pselect in sys/select.
	The check works on freebsd(yes) and fedoracore 3 and 4 (no).
	I hope it also works on Solaris.
	Also various other protoypes were implicit: chroot, strptime, ...
	These are also solved.
   * Wouter: Checked configure on sparc5(solaris). Added check for
	ctime_r in time.h (for tsig.c). This conf also works on freebsd/linux.
   * Wouter: Updated dependencies in makefile for plugin headers.
	These are included only when --enable-plugins is present.
   * Wouter: Added a send quit over socket to kill commands in server_main,
	These act when the fork children fails. If the kill fails, the
	socket command hopefully still works.
   * Wouter: Put reload code into a separate function. It communicates with
	a socket to the old parent, and sends it a quit command. This works
	and terminates the old nsd. Left in the kill as a double failsafe.
	If the reload process dies, then the parent closes the socket.

   * Wouter: Updated dependencies in Makefile (regenerated them with gcc -MM).
   * Wouter: Used splint on the source (with settings to reduce spam.)
	And came to the following changes:
	- In util.h, make it respect HAVE_CONFIG_H and HAVE_SYSLOG_H.
	Also it now defines fallback values for #defines in syslog h.
	- Added explicit cast to (unsigned int) in snprintf in dname.c,
	dname_to_string routine.
   * Wouter: Used extra warnings during gcc compile. -Wextra -Wall 
	-pedantic -Wbad-function-cast -Wmissing-declarations 
	-Wmissing-prototypes -Wnested-externs -Wold-style-definition 
	-Wstrict-prototypes -Wdeclaration-after-statement.
	Using -Wtraditional gives too many warnings.
   * Wouter: Found a problem with pselect. sys/select.h does not by default
	provide the pselect function definition. configure script is 
	adjusted to test for this and enable _XOPEN_SOURCE=600 to get it.
	Found this using the gcc warnings.
   * Wouter: dname and rbtree test apps were in make clean target, but
	do not exist anymore. Removed from make clean target.
   * Wouter: in util log_file() the epoch time_t is passed to printf
	without an int cast. Found using extra gcc warnings.
   * Wouter: In server.c fixed some signed-unsigned comparisons
	using the extra gcc warnings.
	- in shutdown and int was used instead of size_t.
	- in server_main timeout(signed) was compared with unsigned.
	- unused variable in new handler functions.
	- in handle_child_command int i instead of size_t was used.
	- in zonec the process_rr routine was missing (void) as paramlist.
   * Wouter: Added -Wall and -Wextra when --enable-checking is enabled.
   * Miek: Ported over the big fat enable checking configure warning.
   * Wouter: fixed configure check for pselect on freebsd.

   * Wouter: In server.c also sockets from unexpectedly dead childs are closed.
   * Wouter: in nsd.c and server.c cleaned out the signal handler, so that
	it only includes two switch/if statements and alters only the mode. 
	No more calls to alarm(), waitpid(), write(), log_msg().
	Instead the work is done in the runloop in server.c and sent by socket.
	Also the parent now waits for children. Parent restarts them.
   * Wouter: Fixup, the children will quit if the parent closes the command
	socket. If parent is killed, they will exit too.
   * Wouter: The server_main now listens to children command channels.
	Included timeout to check for terminated processes.
	Test says that new signal handler works, and child->parent comm.

07 Feb 2006: nsd-team 
   * Miek: configure.ac version to 3.0.0
   * Miek: looked at: buffer.{ch}, answer.{ch}, dns.{ch}
	   those files don't have any changes, except for dns.{ch} for the
	   explicit compression.
   * Miek: looked at: zlexer.lex and zparser.y; only changes there
	for the database changes.
   * Wouter: Changed buffer in write_pid from 16 bytes to 32 bytes, 
	this makes 64 bit numbers fit in the buffer.
   * Wouter: Socket connection between parent and child nsds added.
	But sighandler now in worse shape. Need to close them. Remove kills.
   * Wouter: close the parent and child command channel sockets in shutdown().
