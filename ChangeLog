   * Miek: configure.ac version to 3.0.0
   * Miek: looked at: buffer.{ch}, answer.{ch}, dns.{ch}
     those files don't have any changes, except for dns.{ch} for the
     explicit compression.
   * Wouter: Changed buffer in write_pid from 16 bytes to 32 bytes, 
		this makes 64 bit numbers fit in the buffer.
