   * Miek: configure.ac version to 3.0.0
   * Miek: looked at: buffer.{ch}, answer.{ch}, dns.{ch}
	   those files don't have any changes, except for dns.{ch} for the
	   explicit compression.
   * Miek: looked at: zlexer.lex and zparser.y; only changes there
           for the database changes.
   * Wouter: Changed buffer in write_pid from 16 bytes to 32 bytes, 
     this makes 64 bit numbers fit in the buffer.
   * Wouter: Socket connection between parent and child nsds added.
     But sighandler now in worse shape. Need to close them. Remove kills.
   * Wouter: close the parent and child command channel sockets in shutdown().
