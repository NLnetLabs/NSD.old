   * Wouter: In server.c also sockets from unexpectedly dead childs are closed.
   * Wouter: in nsd.c and server.c cleaned out the signal handler, so that
	it only includes two switch/if statements and alters only the mode. 
	No more calls to alarm(), waitpid(), write(), log_msg().
	Instead the work is done in the runloop in server.c and sent by socket.
	Also the parent now waits for children. Parent restarts them.

   * Miek: configure.ac version to 3.0.0
   * Miek: looked at: buffer.{ch}, answer.{ch}, dns.{ch}
	   those files don't have any changes, except for dns.{ch} for the
	   explicit compression.
   * Miek: looked at: zlexer.lex and zparser.y; only changes there
	for the database changes.
   * Wouter: Changed buffer in write_pid from 16 bytes to 32 bytes, 
	this makes 64 bit numbers fit in the buffer.
   * Wouter: Socket connection between parent and child nsds added.
	But sighandler now in worse shape. Need to close them. Remove kills.
   * Wouter: close the parent and child command channel sockets in shutdown().
